Alchemy university ethereum developer bootcamp final Project by Guy Shirazi.
The project has a Smart contract which is the back end of the trading platform and a application asfront end website for users to interact with the platform.
In this project, I developed a decentralized gaming asset trading platform using Hardhat and Vite + React for front end. The smart contract enables users to create a Asset struct which contains the asset's ID, price and the address of the owner. the contract also has an array of administrators of the game. the contract creates an event when asset is transfered,created or the price changed. The functions avilable on the smart contract are: buy asset, transfer asset, create asset, add administrator,change asset price and find asset index. further details are in the contract itself (Game.sol) which is also published on Github.

The front-end of the platform allows users to interact with the smart contract. Users can connect to their wallet,create new assets, buy, change price of an asset, add administrators and transfer assets.
